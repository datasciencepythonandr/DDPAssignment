## Use of Application
* To demonstrates how a distribution of randomly generated numbers approximate normal distribution when number of observations gets large
* Slider is used in place of input as per below code
```{r , echo= TRUE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 3, fig.align = "center"}
input = 50
dist <- rnorm(input)
        hist(dist)

```
